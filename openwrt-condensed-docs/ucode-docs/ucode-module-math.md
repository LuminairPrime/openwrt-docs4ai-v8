# Mathematical Functions

The `math` module bundles various mathematical and trigonometrical functions.

Functions can be individually imported and directly accessed using the
[named import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import)
syntax:

  ```
  import { pow, rand } from 'math';

  let x = pow(2, 5);
  let y = rand();
  ```

Alternatively, the module namespace can be imported
using a wildcard import statement:

  ```
  import * as math from 'math';

  let x = math.pow(2, 5);
  let y = math.rand();
  ```

Additionally, the math module namespace may also be imported by invoking the
`ucode` interpreter with the `-lmath` switch.

<a name="module_math+rand"></a>

### math.rand([a], [b]) ⇒ `number`
Depending on the arguments, it produces a pseudo-random positive integer, 
or a pseudo-random number in a supplied range.

Without arguments it returns the calculated pseuo-random value. The value 
is within the range `0` to `RAND_MAX` inclusive where `RAND_MAX` is a platform 
specific value guaranteed to be at least `32767`.

With 2 arguments `a, b` it returns a number in the range `a` to `b` inclusive.
With a single argument `a` it returns a number in the range `0` to `a` inclusive.

The [`srand()`](module:math~srand) function sets its argument as the
seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random integers to be returned by `rand()`.
These sequences are repeatable by calling [`srand()`](module:math~srand)
with the same seed value.

If no seed value is explicitly set by calling
[`srand()`](module:math~srand) prior to the first call to `rand()`,
the math module will automatically seed the PRNG once, using the current
time of day in milliseconds as seed value.

**Kind**: instance method of [`math`](#module_math)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [a] | `number` | End of the desired range. |
| [b] | `number` | The other end of the desired range. |

<a name="module_math+srand"></a>

### math.srand(seed)
Seeds the pseudo-random number generator.

This functions seeds the PRNG with the given value and thus affects the
pseudo-random integer sequence produced by subsequent calls to
[`rand()`](module:math~rand).

Setting the same seed value will result in the same pseudo-random numbers
produced by [`rand()`](module:math~rand).

**Kind**: instance method of [`math`](#module_math)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seed | `number` | The seed value. |

<a name="module_math+isnan"></a>

### math.isnan(x) ⇒ `boolean`
Tests whether `x` is a `NaN` double.

This functions checks whether the given argument is of type `double` with
a `NaN` (not a number) value.

Returns `true` if the value is `NaN`, otherwise false.

Note that a value can also be checked for `NaN` with the expression
`x !== x` which only evaluates to `true` if `x` is `NaN`.

**Kind**: instance method of [`math`](#module_math)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | `number` | The value to test. |
